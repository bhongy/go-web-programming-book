# Postgres - Joining Tables

```sql
-- table alias
-- `as` keyword is optional
table_name as alias_name;
table_name alias_name;

select a, b
from table1
-- inner join
inner join table2 on a = b;
-- left join (a.k.a. left outer join)
left join table2 on a = b;
-- left join (only rows from the left table)
left join table2 on a = b where b is null;
-- right join (a.k.a. right outer join)
right join table2 on a = b;
-- right join (only rows from the right table)
right join table2 on a = b where a is null;
-- full join
full outer join table2 on a = b;
-- full join (only rows unique to both tables)
full outer join table2 on a = b
where a is null or b is null;

-- inner join (short form)
select a, b from table1, table2 on a = b;

-- `using` can be used instead of `on` if the column names are the same in both table
select c.customer_id from customer c, payment p on p.customer_id = c.customer_id;
select c.customer_id from customer c, payment p using(customer_id);

-- To join three tables, place the second `inner join` clause
-- after the first `inner join` clause
